# Overview

- **Sample Name/Label:** KoiStealer
- **Date of Analysis:** 01-06‑2025
- **Summary:** KoiStealer is typically distributed via phishing emails with malicious document attachments. Once executed, it collects browser-stored passwords, autofill data, and basic system information, then exfiltrates the data to a command-and-control server using obfuscated HTTP POST requests. The malware employs string obfuscation, anti‑VM checks, and staged execution to evade detection and delay analysis.
